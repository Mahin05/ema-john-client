            <p className='mt-5'>Question-2: When should you use nodejs and when should you use mongodb?</p>
            <p>Answer:</p>
            <p>NodeJS is a JavaScript runtime environment. It's actually helps JavaScript to run outside of server. It's used in server side development. But, MongoDB is NoSQL database which is document oriented. It represents data as of JSON documents. It's used for store data. The summary is MongoDB is a database where we can store data and NodeJS helps us to to connect our client site to database by it's server site.</p>

            <p className='mt-5'>Question-4: What is the purpose of jwt and how does it work?</p>
            <p>Answer:</p>
            <p>JWT are mainly used for authentication. After a user logs in to an application, the application will create a JWT and send it back to the user. Subsequent requests by the user will include the JWT. The token tells the server what routes, services, and resources the user is allowed to access. JWT can be easily used across multiple domains so they are often used for Single Sign On. JWTs differ from other web tokens in that they contain a set of claims. Claims are used to transmit information between two parties. What these claims are depends on the use case at hand. For example, a claim may assert who issued the token, how long it is valid for, or what permissions the client has been granted.</p>
